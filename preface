Project governance: ( "The alignment of the project with Stakeholders' need or objectives.")

Project phase are not process groups:
    A phase is something like: 
                - "Starting the project"
                - "Optimizing"
                - "Carrying the work"
                - "Closing the work"

Sequential / Overlapping phases.

Predictive Life Cycle (Fully plan driven: Everything is determined as early as possible.)

Iterative and Incremental Life Cycle (project phase (iteration) repeating ).

Adaptive Life Cycle (Change driven / Agile method: short iteration duration)
