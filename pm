Enterprise Environmental Factors

Project governance: ( "The alignment of the project with Stakeholders' need or objectives.")

Project phase are not process groups:
    A phase is something like: 
                - "Starting the project"
                - "Optimizing"
                - "Carrying the work"
                - "Closing the work"

Sequential / Overlapping phases.

Predictive Life Cycle (Fully plan driven: Everything is determined as early as possible.)

Iterative and Incremental Life Cycle (project phase (iteration) repeating ).

Adaptive Life Cycle (Change driven / Agile method: short iteration duration)

Work Performance Data (Raw observations and measurement)
    - percent of work completed
    - performance measurement
    - start / finish dates
    - number of defects

Work Performance Information (Data collected and analyzed in context)
    - status deliverables
    - implementation status for change requests
    - forecasted estimates


Work Performance reports (Representation of work):
    - Status reports
